# Colors.txt
A Color file for the new real time Minetest MapServer

for easy updates you can clone this repo in the mintest root folder,
create a simlink in your world folder where the mapserver executable is.

the unused.txt file will serve as a place to hold colors for mods you may not use or want.
you may cut and past between colors.txt and unused.txt accordingly

this is an auto generated colors file.
A starting point that will be modified manually, allowing for a nicer looking map.
